#' Wine Data Set
#'
#' This data set is the combination of two datasets that were created, using red and white wine samples.
#' The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data
#' (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality
#' between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Several data mining methods were applied to model
#' these datasets under a regression approach. The support vector machine model achieved the
#' best results. Several metrics were computed: MAD, confusion matrix for a fixed error tolerance (T),
#' etc. Also, we plot the relative importances of the input variables (as measured by a sensitivity

#' Autompg Data Set
#'
#' This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in
#' the StatLib library.  In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in
#' predicting the attribute "mpg", 8 of the original instances were removed
#' because they had unknown values for the "mpg" attribute.
#' @format A data frame with 398 observations on the following 9 variables.
#' - `mpg`: continuous
#' - `cylinders`:     multi-valued discrete
#' - `displacement`:  continuous
#' - `horsepower`:    continuous
#' - `weight`:        continuous
#' - `acceleration`:  continuous
#' - `model_year`:    multi-valued discrete
#' - `origin`:        multi-valued discrete
#' - `car_name`:      string (unique for each instance)
#' @source This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is
#' maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset was
#' used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition.

#' Bike Sharing (Daily) Data Set
#'
#' Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where
#' whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic.
#' Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular
#' position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about
#' over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over
#' 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems
#' due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.
#'
#' Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the
#' characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive
#' for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway,
#' the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded
#' in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual
#' sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it
#' is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via
#' monitoring these data.
